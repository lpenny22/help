  <FAQ Question="How do I add or remove a skill?"
         Answer="DXC should not want to receive another party’s confidential information because DXC will&#xA; 
                 then have the burden to maintain that information as confidential, and DXC’s freedom of&#xD; 
                 invention and action may be compromised because of knowing such confidential information.&lt;br /&gt; 
                 <![CDATA[However, in situations where it is necessary for DXC to receive such sensitive information<br />]]> 
                 from another party, a proper Confidential Disclosure Agreement (CDA) should be executed<br /> 
                 before receiving such information. Please refer to the “Receiving Sensitive Information”<br /> 
                 section in the &lt;a href=&quot; http://standards.int.hpe.com/policy/docs/hpe010-04.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;DXC Confidential Information Policy&lt;/a&gt;.">

  <FAQ Question="How do I view my skills?"
       Answer="In general, these are just different titles for the same type of document intended to protect<br />
               the disclosure of sensitive information. At DXC, we refer to this document as a Confidential<br /> 
               Disclosure Agreement (CDA). Please note that a CDA or NDA is different than the document<br /> 
               called the Non-Confidential Disclosure Agreement (“NCDA”), which is intended to establish<br /> 
               that neither party is sharing anything of confidential nature.">
